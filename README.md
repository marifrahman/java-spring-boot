# Testing java-spring-boot 
Just a demo to try java with sprint and spring boot

It will be REST api that will take an integer array and perform calculations :
1. Find highest 3 numbers in the array
2. Compute Square of each of the three numbers
3. Sum the squared numbers.
4. Return Squarerroot of the sum

Following things are also considered.
- Use java Stream to compute
- Included unit tests

I have used VS Code as the editor - which was also fun as a Dotnet developer.
